        be added for this?\n\nThe UI can benefit from some cleanup later, notably
        `bzr resolve` gives a return code if there are pending conflicts, and there
        are slightly different spellings of the results.\n\nHaving the pending conflicts
        returned by the auto_resolve method is actually a little useful. In general,

        itself, but at the moment there is no way to fetch or set any of them.\nI
        suppose that since the interaction with all the metadata strictly belongs
        to commit itself, it''s reasonable to create the hook, allowing plugin to
        modify the metadata for the Commit class.\n\nAs a proof of concept I have
        implemented the ''cimage'' plugin[1], which utilizes the start_hook invented
        in this diff to add the user webcam photo to commit metadata. Later the photo
        can be fetched from metadata by appropriate command. Practically, all the
        cimage branch commits are equipped with the stored photos so one can easily
        install plugin, checkout that branch and view them.\n\n[1] http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~torkvemada/+junk/bzr-cimage/view/head:/__init__.py",

        to allow checkout/branch of repositories containing symlinks on Windows platform.
        The approach is to simply ignore symlinks and issue a warning about unsupported

        is discussed https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr/+bug/81689 with comments starting
        with #28.\n\nThe patch isn''t quite ready for merge yet and I still need to
        write additional tests. Just wanted to put this up here so I can improve it

        a conflict is detected, it reports the conflicts and mails them to related
        users. \nThe goal now is to propose to the developer to simply checkout a

        parsing the response header (ok, error, etc). Not while reading the actual
        body content. However, as mentioned in the beginning, that is the use case
        that we really care about. We are trying to allow the server to soft-disconnect
        us, in which case it shouldn''t send any response at all.\n\n(The other thing
        we could have done is upgraded the RPC to allow the server to send a ''reconnect''
        message, but that wouldn''t have been compatible with older clients, especially
        since they wouldn''t have been listening for that response at the end of a
        previous message, etc.)\n\nNote that I''ve tested this by running bzr.dev

        "date_merged": null, "description": "1) I analyzed all of the requests that
        are currently registered as to whether they are safe or not to retry. I ended
        up with 4 categories:\n\n#   safe    The request is strictly idempotent, calling
        it twice results in\n#           the same result as calling it one time. This
        includes all read-only\n#           requests, and write requests like ''put''
        where the end result is\n#           identical content.\n#   unsafe  A request
        which is unsafe means that state is updated in a way that\n#           replaying
        that request results in a different state. For example\n#           ''append''
        writes more bytes to a given file. If append succeeds, it\n#           moves
        the file pointer.\n#   semi    This is a request that isn''t strictly idempotent,
        but doesn''t\n#           result in corruption if it is retried. This is for
        things like\n#           ''lock'' and ''unlock''. If you call lock, it updates
        the disk\n#           structure. If you fail to read the response, you won''t
        be able to\n#           use the lock, because you don''t have the lock token.
        Calling lock\n#           again will fail, because the lock is already taken.
        However, we\n#           can''t tell if the server received our request or
        not. If it didn''t,\n#           then retrying the request is fine, as it
        will actually do what we\n#           want. If it did, we will interrupt the
        current operation, but we\n#           are no worse off than interrupting
        the current operation because of\n#           a ConnectionReset.\n#   stream  This
        is a request that takes a stream that cannot be restarted if\n#           consumed.
        This request is ''safe'' in that if we determine the\n#           connection
        is closed before we consume the stream, we can try\n#           again.\n\n2)
        The retry code will ultimately only care if something is ''unsafe'' or not,
        so we could simplify this list if we wanted. Or we could extend it to split
        ''safe'' into differentiating between ''read-only'' and ''idempotent''.\n\nOne
        interesting potential from this classification, is that we could actually
        test it. Specifically, for each request, we set up a RemoteRepository in some
        sort of state. We could then create a test that:\n a) for ''read-only'', after
        the request is sent, there is no change on disk.\n b) for ''idempotent'' there
        is a change, however, sending the request a second time, there is no change.\n
        c) for ''semi'', there is some change on disk, sending the request a second
        time causes a client-side failure (exception is raised)\n d) for ''stream'',
        I''m not really sure\n e) for ''unsafe'' we could confirm that sending the
        request once results in a change, and sending it again, results in yet-another
        change.\n\nHowever, the test suite setup is non-trivial, since you need specific
        arguments for every function. Which is an awful lot of scenarios to describe.\n\n3)
        I decided to add this to registry, rather that putting it on the classes themselves.
        Either would be fine, as we only need to lookup one request at runtime that
        actually got ConnectionReset. The main reason I went this route is that I
        want to make sure a human looks at every request and determines its safety.
        Adding it as a class attribute tends to leave it as the default from inheritance,
        which makes it a little too easy to mark something safe when it isn''t. And
        if you get it wrong, this is something that only causes corruption when you
        get a ConnectionReset at exactly the right time. So really hard to debug and
        diagnose.\n\n4) This is one of those patches that will definitely need to
        be updated to merge it to newer versions of bzr, since it touches so many
        lines of code, and we are very likely to have added new RPCs since bzr 2.1.",

        call to ''bzr push''. However, we write after every entry in the stream, and
        the first entry of the stream is actually very small. (bzrlib.repository._stream_to_byte_stream()

        "date_merged": null, "description": "This is some initial work for having
        clients reconnect when their bzr+ssh (or bzr://) connection gets closed underneath
        them.\n\nTo start with, the trickiest bit is that it is really quite hard
        to detect when things are closed. Mostly because of buffering, etc, at lots
        of different levels (internal memory buffering, socket/pipe buffering, ''ssh.exe''
        buffering, latency of close message from server back to client, etc.)\n\nI''ll
        also clarify that this isn''t intended to handle all possible sorts of connection
        failures. What we really are trying to handle is allowing a server to be upgraded
        ''live''. Such that the server will gently disconnect us only between complete
        requests. Versus having requests terminated randomly in the middle of content.
        It may help with some of those cases, and we certainly don''t want to cause
        corruption, etc if one of those happens. But it isn''t the goal of *this*
        change.\n\n\n\nThis specific patch has a few aspects, and does help some cases
        in real-world testing.\n\n1) Backport a minimum amount of the SmartSSHClientMedium
        proxies to _real_medium patch from Andrew. In bzr-2.2 Andrew updated the code
        so that when spawning an ''ssh'' subprocess, we use a socketpair when possible
        instead of pipes. (That way we can read without blocking, allowing us to use
        large buffers, etc.)\n\nIt also meant that he shared the logic from SmartSimplePipeStreamMedium
        and SmartTCPClientMedium, which I wanted to do, to avoid having to re-implement
        the logic multiple times.\n\nThis is a pretty small part of the patch.\n\n2)
        Update some of the lower level code so that we get ConnectionReset rather
        than various IOError and ValueError when writing to a closed connection.\n\n3)
        Update the _SmartClient._send_request logic. If we get a ConnectionReset while
        we are trying to write the request, then we can safely retry the request.
        On the assumption that as long as the server doesn''t see the final ''e''
        terminal byte, it will reject the request, because it is incomplete.\n\n4)
        The one caveat is if there is a ''body_stream''. body_stream is an iterable,
        so we can''t just rewind it and resume it.\n\nOn the plus side, there is only
        one caller RemoteStreamSink.insert_stream. In theory we could update that
        caller. In practice, it *also* takes a ''stream'' object, which can''t simply
        be rewound. Though we do a ''no-op'' stream just before the real content to
        determine that the remote server actually supports the RPC we want to use.\n\nThat
        would allow us to close the gap a little bit. So we can detect ConnectionReset
        all the way to the point that we actually start streaming the content.\n\nThe
        other bit that would be possible, is to update ProtocolThreeRequester.call_with_body_stream
        to allow it to set a flag to indicate whether it has actually started consuming
        the stream yet. Then update it to flush just before it iterates the body stream
        to help force detecting closed connections. (otherwise we are likely to have
        buffered at least the first part of the body_stream in local memory, since
        the local buffer is 1MB and the first flush is only called after the first
        chunk of the body_stream.)\n\nThis just closes a window where we won''t reconnect
        during ''bzr push''.\n\n5) The next step is that (especially for sockets),
        we write out the request successfully, and then notice it is closed when we
        try to read back the response.\n\nHere I''m a lot more concerned about non-idempotent
        requests. Because the server might have fully read the request, and sent back
        a response, but we didn''t get to see the response.\n\nHowever, our RPC design
        is meant to be stateless (all state is passed in the request, not assumed
        to be stored on the server side). Which means things *should* be idempotent.
        For something like ''put_bytes'', we may write the same content twice, but
        we shouldn''t corrupt anything.\n\nThe only one I can think of is ''append_bytes'',
        and the associated open_write_stream() code. (RemoteTransport.open_write_stream
        uses AppendBasedFileStream as its implementation.)\n\nAnd that code shouldn''t
        really be used with up-to-date bzr clients and servers. So I''m much more
        ok with it just dying if it isn''t safe to retry.", "merge_reporter_link":

        to turn it on.  (See bug 408192, bug 625597, though \n  this is not exactly
        what was discussed.)\n\n* UnicodeOrBytesToBytesWriter had the somewhat confusing
        behavior of\n  printing the repr of the wrapped object.\n\n* The indentation
        of test failures did not fit well with testtools'' behavior\n  of returning
        the whole traceback as part of the error string.\n\n* We shouldn''t print
        the whole traceback for known failures.  Just \n  the reason string is enough.  (Bug
        499713)\n\n* To let the unicode-escaping code work, we need to pass it the
        error \n  as a unicode string.\n\n* Don''t attach empty log files; as a consequence
        the log is not attached\n  until the test completes.  (However, it can still
        be read from \n  TestCase.get_log()).\n\n* Bugs in old subunits do not deserve
        a ''known failure'' in bzr.  Only\n  things we could fix (without time travel)
        should get that.", "merge_reporter_link": null, "preview_diffs_collection_link":

        patch I kept all the changes strictly in the bzr-gtk. Jelmer rightfully commented
        that some of these changes belong to the bzr itself, not to the gtk plugin.\n\nAnd
        I''m suggesting it here now.\n\nHere''s the problem. bzr-gtk wraps ''bzr uncommit''
        to store the changeset comment of the removed changeset. On the next ''bzr
        gcommit'' this comment is used to pre-fill the comment input form.\n\nBut
        ''bzr commit --fixes'' takes bug id''s in the form of lp:12345, but stores
        them in the changeset as http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/12345. So, this patch
        adds the functionality of reverting this transformation, and converting bug
        urls back to bug ids.\n\nI''ve only implemented this reverting for UniqueIntegerBugTracker
        to avoid doing extra work if you reject the patch straight away. Of course,
        if you''ll consider taking it I''ll fix other classes too.\n\nAdditionally

        was Sergei''s intention in the earlier merge proposal:\n\u003chttps://code.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/bzr/diffoptions/+merge/52325\u003e\n]\n\nThanks,
        John, for the discussion.\n\nLet me summarize:\n1. It''s not always easy to
        find the \"current branch\" to be able to get its config.\n2. having \"-F
        regex\" specified only globally is not flexible enough, as different branches
        (e.g. one with the C code, another with the Python code) may need different
        regexps.\n2.1 Actually, even one regexp per branch is not enough, as one branch
        may have both python and C files.\n3. Allowing the user to specify arbitrary
        diff options that affect all generated diffs is too dangerous - \"diff -w\"
        will break merge bundles (and \"diff -c\" breaks bzr shelve and everything
        that parses diffs).\n3.1 But \"diff -p\" seems to be safe everywhere.\n\nSo,
        I took another approach. It''s more strict and more flexible at the same time.
        More flexible as in the 2.1 above (regexp can be specified per file or a group
        of files) and more strict as in the 3.1 above (only diff -p - really, diff
        -F - is allowed).\n\nThe patch uses rules to find the regexp for a given tree
        and for a given file. And runs external diff with -F regexp command-line option.\n\nPlease,
        see the patch. It lacks tests and the documentation is not updated - but it
        works, and shows the approach.", "merge_reporter_link": null, "preview_diffs_collection_link":

        configuration policy, \"appenddir\".  This new\npolicy is similar to appendpath,
        except that it appends only the last path\nelement to the value.  Here''s
        an example configuration:\n\n[/home/abentley/bzr]\npublic_branch = lp:~abentley/bzr\npublic_branch:policy
        = appenddir\n\nThis means that the public branch for \"/home/abentley/bzr/foo\"
        will be\n\"lp:~abentley/bzr/foo\", as with appendpath.  But the public branch
        of\n\"/home/abentley/bzr/bar/foo\" will *also* be \"lp:~abentley/bzr/foo\",
        whereas\nappendpath would make it \"lp:~abentley/bzr/bar/foo\".  While the
        appendpath\nbehaviour may be useful for some, it produces too-long branch
        names in many\ncases.\n\nMy motivating case is \"bzr-pipeline\".  When a pipeline
        is created with\n\"reconfigure-pipeline\", the branch is converted into a
        lightweight checkout,\nwith branches at \".bzr/pipes/\".  If the push location
        had been set with\nappendpath, a push location of \"lp:~abentley/bzr/foo\"
        would become\n\"lp:~abentley/bzr/.bzr/pipes/foo\", which is undesirable.  With
        appenddir, it\nwould retain the value \"lp:~abentley/bzr/foo\".  I believe
        bzr-colo has the same\nissue.\n\nWhile the new policy is syntactically compatible
        with existing config files,\ncurrent versions of bzr treat unknown configuration
        policies as internal\nerrors:\n*** Bazaar has encountered an internal error.  This
        probably indicates a\n    bug in Bazaar.  You can help us fix it by filing
        a bug report at\n        https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr/+filebug\n    including
        this traceback and a description of the problem.\n\nI would be happy to create
        a bugfix for earlier bzrs so that they emit a\nuser-friendly error when they
        encounter unknown configuration policies.", "merge_reporter_link": null, "preview_diffs_collection_link":

        have implemented a proof of concept loggerhead viz view which use this. This
        is available here: lp:~garyvdm/loggerhead/loggraphviz\n\nThere is still lots
        of work that I would like to do before this actually lands. E.g.:\n* The doc
        strings need to be completed, improved, and reviewed.\n* I want to have the
        api between the State objects, and Filters, especially how one adds a filter
        to a state more clearly defined.\n* I need to mark private/internal methods
        with _.\n* I want to do a bzr-gtk viz poc. viz has a number of features that
        qlog does not, i.e. progress bar, a revision command line argument to specify
        a tip., and a limit argument. Implementing these my result in api changes.\n*
        I would like to still investigate doing partial loading of merge sorted revisions
        using bzr-history-db for the use of loggerhead. This may also result in api
        changes.\n\nSo I know this is not 100% ready, but I feel that as I have now
        done the loggerhead poc, I now feel the time is right to get some comments

        code around AddAction and smart_add.  The existing api was sufficiently complicated,
        and as far I can tell not used by plugins, so I think it''s better just to
        delete it.  This is a bit cleaner on its own, but also detangles things a
        bit to allower a larger refactoring of smart_add to be smaller and to use
        an inventory delta rather than mutating the in-memory inventory.  (bug 79336
        asked for this a long time ago; it was worked-around in bzr-svn but it would
        be better to give them a simpler interface).\n\nThere are essentially two
        ways callers might want to customize smart_add: a way to generate file ids
        (for example to match those in an existing tree) and to report on what''s
        being done (typically to a file).  For no good reason they were tied together
        into a somewhat strange callable object callback.  Instead, there are now
        just plain callables for each.\n\nBefore merging this I''ll check whether
        it impacts other things that may be adding files or implementing smart_add,
        including bzr-svn, the package importer, and bzr builder.  Generally things
        that are mechanically adding files shouldn''t need to call smart_add.\n\nIt
        might be nice to have a reporter object that''s told about more actions from
        inside add and can do more than just say the files that were added. \n\n",

        command help was once again failing due to options with dots in them, like
        \"--1.14\".  Neither plain ReST nor Sphinx''s option markup allows for dots
        in option names.  Previously we were doing a rather fragile hack by looking
        for a fixed string in the output, and if so doing a crude string munging to
        make all branch format options get rendered as preformatted text.\n\nThis
        change instead subclasses optparse''s IndentedHelpFormatter to make it emit
        more appropriate Sphinx markup in the first place.  Because that markup cannot
        support our options with dots in the names, I resort to using \".. describe:\"
        (i.e. a description list in HTML terms, \u003cdl\u003e etc).  I also use \"..
        cssclass:\" so that I can add some simple CSS to tweak the rendering to more
        closely resemble the existing output (which when it worked was nicer than
        a raw description list).\n\nHopefully this will prove less fragile, although
        I''m not sure if that will work out to be true in practice.\n\nPerhaps instead
        we should fix bug 330494, to remove those option names?  It seems a bit perverse
        to change our UI to match an oversight in our documentation tools, though.",

        "date_merged": null, "description": "=== Fixes Bug #300062 ===\n\nThis started
        out as a simple bug fix to ensure that ''bzr ignore'' handles invalid patterns
        correctly but as invalid patterns impacted other commands this patch ended
        up fixing those as well. bzr can encounter invalid patterns in either .bzrignore
        file or .bazaar/ignore file. These could earlier get in either by using ''bzr
        ignore'' or by editing the files directly. The former is now fixed. This patch
        fixes the following:\n1. ''bzr ignore'' when supplied with possibly multiple
        patterns, filters out invalid patters and only adds valid patterns to .bzrignore\n\n2.
        ''bzr status'' checks ignore patterns before showing status. This was crashing
        if invalid patterns were present. ''bzr status'' now issues a warning if invalid
        pattern(s) are seen and does not crash. In order to avoid any performance
        penalty, `status` works as before, but if it sees sees re.error then it parser
        both ignore files and prints out the bad pattern(s).\n\n3. ''bzr add'' checks
        ignore patterns before adding files. This was crashing if invalid patterns
        were present. ''bzr add'' now exists with an error message indicating invalid
        patterns. Initially I was trying to decide between a warning or error for
        this but decided that its better for `add` to not be too smart as it might
        end up adding files that were meant to be ignored.\n\nImplementations Notes\n=====================\nAs
        `re` is lazy by default. I have added a function `bzrlib.lazy_regex.eager_re_compile`
        that is used by `bzrlib.globbing.is_pattern_valid` which in turn is used by
        to create `bzrlib.globbing.filter_invalid_patterns`. This is used by `ignore`
        command to ensure that no junk enters .bzrignore.\n\n`bzrlib.ignores` has
        two new functions, `get_pattern_errors` gives information about bad patterns
        in .bzrignore and .bazaar/ignore. `show_pattern_errors` is used to display
        warning about bad patterns to the user. `show_pattern_errors` is used by `status`.
        `get_pattern_errors` is used by `add` which raises error `InvalidIgnorePattern`.\n\nI
        noticed that imports in bzrlib.status and bzrlib.ignores were not lazy. So
        I have made these lazy and I had to add a few imports to these files.\n\nTests
        have been added as needed.\n", "merge_reporter_link": null, "preview_diffs_collection_link":

        it won''t know that it will want to until after reading the branch.conf --
        i.e. after the read-lock has been acquired.\n\nUnfortunately, we don''t have
        an API to upgrade a read lock to write lock, so instead this patch opens a
        separate instance of the (already read-locked) branch so it can write-lock
        that and set the push location.  That second instance is then discarded.  The
        downside, as explained in the comment, is that the read-locked version will
